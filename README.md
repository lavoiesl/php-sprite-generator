Note that sprites may not always be the best solution:

## Usage

1. Start a test server: `php -S localhost:9999`
2. Open http://localhost:9999/?sprite=flags.

### Arguments

 - `sprite`: The folder name inside `sources`, which contain all the individual images.
 - `format`: One of `(html|jpe?g|gif|png|css|less)`.
 - `size` (optional): Resize the width, in pixels, of the whole sprite. By default, it will grow to accommodate the orignal images.

 - Support different sizes of images in the same sprite.
